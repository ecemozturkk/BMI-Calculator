# BMI Calculator ðŸ¥—

This is a Body Mass Index calculator, designed to help users assess their body weight in relation to their height. The app uses the user's input of weight and height to calculate their body mass, and then provides personalized health advice based on the results. The app takes into account whether the user has been consuming an excessive amount of pies, or if they need to eat more, in order to maintain a healthy weight. To ensure an organized and efficient design, I employed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model in the development of this app. By utilizing this model, I was able to structure the different components of the app in a way that optimizes functionality and user experience.

## Key Features

During this app, I've learned how to:
* Use UISliders
* Create Swift Classes
* Understand the difference between Classes and Struct
* Learn to create UI programmatically without Storyboards
* Create multi-screen apps by learning about segues
* Learn about advanced features of Optionals, including Optional Binding, Optional Chaining and the Nil Coalescing Operator
